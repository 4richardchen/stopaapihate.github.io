I recognize the inspiration from [R.O. Kwon]'s "[A Letter to My Fellow Asian Women Whose Hearts Are Breaking](//t.co/0aOQwx5j3a)" ([Tweet](//twitter.com/rokwon/status/1373047425129062404)). Presume zero men's rights activists' (whom I abhor) motives i.e. that this article evens the score for men, rather, I compassionately appeal to my fellow Asian American father to know they are felt, heard, and understood.

We feel like we can't keep our families, ourselves, parents safe. We question was it worth it to be here in this wicked land. We wonder how much worse it'll get (it will). How many more daily regular anti-AAPI macroaggressions occur. What kind of a world this means for our kids. How do we arm our children? Ourselves? Are we leaving a better world behind? Do we belong?

It is depressing to see our [elders](//twitter.com/josie_huang/status/1373483342771888133) have to fight onwards, decades themselves in the battle, wearing the war(time) saddle thin. Our inner demons swing from wanting to blame everyone including ourselves for being quiet to any doubters of how we got here to wondering if we made jokes at the cost of others to foment unintentional hate to witnessing our falling into deep mental trouble to self-checking if we have missed something in our past.

You are heard. You belong. You are seen. You are worthy. Men need to say this out loud to each other just as we must [say their names](//twitter.com/jollenelevid/status/1372969652247175170) out loud (and [pronounce properly](//twitter.com/aaja/status/1373017160818122755)). Acknowledge the feelings. They trap you in the past. Get the spiritual high like one from a hippie, commune living, new age, digital nomad, MDMA-aided, Burning Man by unpacking your emotions. Your cup must be full to be able to fill those of your wife, kids, others who need you intact, present, able.

Share the overwhelming new emotions from seeing how we're hated, attacked, killed for being. We've spent the week news reading, doomscrolling, crying without warning, Googling gun ownership, overeating, attacking close people, trolling randoms, Googling emmigration, working extra, surfing extra, avoiding silence, avoiding people, crying in the dark, staying up to exhaustion, oversharing as a cry for help. Find your way to express what you feel but don't, can't express. It's unspoken we are overwhelmed with emotions normally hard to express atop ones which were already pent up, unaddressed, unpacked. In whatever arena you have, at club sports, alumni happy hours, ClubHouse, watering holes, mentor chats, get deep into the discussions that matter. As heard [here at 08:55-09:10, 12:23-12:37](//www.instagram.com/p/CL_NvNanIRA), we want to be heard without judgement. Create the emotional availability to speak, be present, to give again. Your families need you now. Godspeed, men.
