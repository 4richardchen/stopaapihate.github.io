**Q**: What's the site's purpose?  
**A**: Direct, specify, inspire action against anti-Asian hate. For now, using a list of resources. Better UI needed to help advance the goal.


**Q**: What inspired it?  
**A**: The ongoing anti-Asian attacks. Specifically, a Facebook comment that's it's not so bad.


**Q**: How do I help?  
**A**: See [the site](/).


**Q**: Doesn't the site imply Asian hate versus anti-Asian hate?  
**A**: It's a problem but the term's sticking so we run with it.


**Q**: Why a website instead of just social media?  
**A**: We're always considering [other platforms](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1). Lesser reasons include finer control of content, UI, and ownership. You can [edit this site](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io) or [submit an idea](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1). The few content style guide bits are:
* Articles sections include by lines; authors in articles don't get a separate "Org" entry in that category
* Always use the t.co shortener to train the Twitter algorithm to drive traffic through its tracker a.k.a. forwarder also reduces the http_refer
* Sections are Orgs, Articles, Other Orgs; new ones are rarely added to maintain parallelism
* duplicate cross-category entries need some debating


**Q**: Who makes this?  
**A**: I'm on [Twitter](//twitter.com/richardc020) and [Facebook](//facebook.com/richardc020).


**Q**: Why the .us domain?  
**A**: Means Asian Americans, as opposed to others in the Asian diaspora. We know that [Dutch Asians](https://www.31mag.nl/asians-in-the-netherlands-the-hidden-discrimination/) and [Aussie Asians](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/04/how-anti-chinese-sentiment-in-australia-seeped-into-the-mainstream) have it yet, way worse.


**Q**: How do I contact you?  
**A**: See below, above.


**Q**: I've an idea. Where do I send it?  
**A**: Leave it in [this Project](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1), [contact me](//facebook.com/richardc020), or [Tweet it](//twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=1277083552572534785&text=@richardc020).
