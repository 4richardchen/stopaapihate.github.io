Q: What's the site's purpose?

A: Direct, specify, inspire action against anti-Asian hate. For now, using a list of resources. Better UI needed to help advance the goal.

Q: What inspired it?

A: The ongoing anti-Asian attacks. Specifically, a Facebook comment that's it's not so bad.


Q: How do I help?

A: See [the site](/).


Q: Doesn't the site imply Asian hate versus anti-Asian hate?

A: It's a problem but the term's sticking so we run with it.


Q: Why a website instead of another platform (we've a list at our [Project](https://github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen))?

A: So I control the content, UI, format, pages, etc. You can [edit this site](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io) or [submit an idea](https://github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen).


Q: Who're you?

A: I'm [Richard Chen](//facebook.com/richardc020).


Q: Why the .us domain?

A: Means Asian Americans, as opposed to others in the Asian diaspora. We know that [Dutch Asians](https://www.31mag.nl/asians-in-the-netherlands-the-hidden-discrimination/) and [Aussie Asians](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/04/how-anti-chinese-sentiment-in-australia-seeped-into-the-mainstream) have it yet, way worse.


Q: How do I contact you?

A: See below.


Q: I've an idea. Where do I send it?

A: Leave it in [this Project](https://github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen), [contact me](//facebook.com/richardc020), or [Tweet it](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=1277083552572534785&text=@richardc020).
