**Q**: What's the site's purpose?  
**A**: Direct, specify, inspire action against anti-Asian hate. For now, using a list of resources. Better UI needed to help advance the goal.


**Q**: What inspired it?  
**A**: The ongoing anti-Asian attacks. Specifically, a Facebook comment that's it's not so bad.


**Q**: How do I help?  
**A**: See [the site](/).


**Q**: Doesn't the site imply Asian hate versus anti-Asian hate?  
**A**: It's a problem but the term's sticking so we run with it.


**Q**: Why a website instead of just social media?  
**A**: We're always considering [other platforms](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1). Lesser reasons include finer control of content, UI, and ownership. You can [edit this site](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io) or [submit an idea](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1). The few content style guide bits are:
* Articles sections include by lines; authors in articles don't get a separate "Org" entry in that category
* Always use [t.co](//t.co/fTfHbfBr9W) shortener to train the Twitter algorithm to drive traffic through its tracker
    * every link is there but if not, bit.ly then
    * forwarder also reduces the http_refer
    * never FDL](//t.co/izGFLHeKQe) to lower their data haul
* Sections are Orgs, Articles, Other Orgs; new ones are rarely added to maintain parallelism
* duplicate cross-category entries need some debating


**Q**: Who makes this?  
**A**: I'm on [Twitter](//twitter.com/richardc020) and [Facebook](//facebook.com/richardc020).


**Q**: What're his credentials for speaking out?
**A**: I've 22y of experience working in AAPI social awareness, founded CMU's Rotaract International chapter with Clarence Cheung in 2001, volunteered for Amnesty International 1995-1999, and have edited Wikipedia for AAPI history (see [history](history)) for 15y. More recently, I created this site, am a founding moderatorof [AsiansNOW](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow), and contribute to many community causes including [WearYellowProudly's collaboration](//docs.google.com/document/d/16IoBqmZmMgstF77oNthARTcyMBY0eY_YRPnzfktFCQo/edit?fbclid=IwAR1HmfHrpb4ps5T9-siC7LAxSpfJr5nZFThkCNXMN0rfIwqyQVlGrEL6H40) and [AAPI Townhall's collaboration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ofWEB6ZIPI6emYuYwPwWOuFcqGpk9tXgXLmXxeJqsIQ/edit#heading=h.lfq6c1xxlgom). I was interviewed by Zhao Yuying of World Magazine [this article](//mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bF4EG8dXU3EQnqel6-3Ibw) in its last paragraph under my Chinese name, 陈治恺.


**Q**: Why the .us domain?  
**A**: Means Asian Americans, as opposed to others in the Asian diaspora. We know that [Dutch Asians](https://www.31mag.nl/asians-in-the-netherlands-the-hidden-discrimination/) and [Aussie Asians](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/04/how-anti-chinese-sentiment-in-australia-seeped-into-the-mainstream) have it yet, way worse.


**Q**: Why not StopAsianHate?
**A**: (see `.us`)


**Q**: How do I contact you?  
**A**: See below, above.


**Q**: I've an idea. Where do I send it?  
**A**: Leave it in [this Project](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1), [contact me](//facebook.com/richardc020), or [Tweet it](//twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=1277083552572534785&text=@richardc020).
