Q: How bad is it?

A: 89y old Brooklyn Cantonese female set on fire unprovoked in July 2020. [Vichar Ratanapakdee](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Vicha_Ratanapakdee), 84, Oakland, Thai, male murdered unprovoked on January 28, 2021 with perp's face hidden from public reporting. A 91y old man in San Francisco Chinatown from behind unprovoked, killed by black perps [caught on video](//twitter.com/DionLimTV/status/1356098895604895745) including Antoine Watson, 19, yet District Attorney Chesa Boudin refuses to charge it as a hate crime plus the grandma used the release on bail to further disrespect the victim's family. Yong Zheng, 46, killed during a robbery of a Fujianese gambling den in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, NY on March 2, 2021 by [10 black perps](//www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-stabbing-screwdriver-brooklyn-gambling-den-accomplices-20210302-fdxs5lfl5jcxxnspz5bkiupitq-story.html). [Ee Lee](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Ee_Lee), 36, raped, murdered in Washington Park, Milwaukee on September 19, 2020 with perps reveling in video. [Noriko Nasu](//www.kiro7.com/news/local/northshore-educator-seriously-injured-possible-hate-crime-attack/264KWNL3VBE5RB2KVMH6FE3H5U) attacked violently, unprovoked in Seattle's Chinatown on February 25, 2021. Chinese man, 36, stabbed in back unprovoked in Manhattan Chinatown on February 28, 2021 by another [black perp](//nextshark.com/chinatown-asian-man-stabbing-new-york/). There're 16 such reports in NYC for 2021, endless really such as [this latest](//twitter.com/CeFaanKim/status/1367168575098802182). Dozens others made local news. Latest as of writing is [this one](//abc7news.com/video-shows-attack-on-older-asian-man-in-sf-laundromat/10386627) about which few will read as most either don't want to read the news or have social media distorting their intake. Hundreds others made community private social media. Thousands (2,088 as of March 1, 2021) of reports to StopAAPIHate.org. Law enforcement and public prosecutors refuse to investigate or prosecute such crimes until significant media attention, and even then the judiciary is reluctant to prosecute black perps of Asian victims for reasons we've yet to know.

Q: How are 3 more than 29 crimes last year that bad?

A1: The oft-used [DOJ OJP](//ojp.gov) [BJS](//bjs.gov) [NCVS](//bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=91) stat of only 29 on-Asian hate crimes in 2019 is misleading in addition to [prosecutorial problems](#prosection).

A2: It's a 900% uptick, a 1500% uptick, there're many categories and ways to measure it but we're unsure statistics will work given disinformation thus not spending time collecting news versus [action](/).


Q: What's the story?

A: Violent, unprovoked attacks on Asians each 2-3 days average for a year. Reasons are unknown but may include consequences of bail reform, mental illness, [copycat syndrome](//www.quora.com/What-is-a-copycat-syndrome), decrease, lockdown effects (isolation, desperation, amplification of all the aforementioned), political extremism (model minority myth driven by white supremacy) may all add to the mix.


Q: Isn't racism not a mental illness?

A: It's not, but mental illness may mix with poverty, violent tendencies, poor upbringings causing further bad decision making, cultures of disrespect, glorification of violence, gun violence, etc. to motivate more such attacks. Unfortuately, legal system lets mental illness get such perps off scot-free.


Q: Why to avoid being anti-black in such work?

A: Racism doesn't justify racism. No unnecessary race wars. They won't help our cause.

Q: Aren't all the perps black?

A: All are for the 13 violent crimes of 2021. I didn't write a list out but should. This problem is already worked out in very progressive circles, basically that such perps inhabit dozens of social ailments, but has no easy airing in mainstream, less progressive circles much less the oppressive ones which seek to drive a wedge. Not gonna happen.

Q: Aren't Asians racist, too?

A: Sure, but see aforementioned.


Q: Why are Asians so quiet?

A: We're not quiet, see [#TheyCantBurnUsAll](//twitter.com/theycantburnusall) for a reality check about Asian America today. Model minority myth harms us so we reappropriate it for ourselves. Some were quiet because they were paying the bills as an immigrant far from home in an unfamiliar land refusing to give them rightful opportunities (we don't forget) to no fault of theirs. Others have language difficulties or don't know how America works. No more.


Q: Do Asians take blame?

A: No, such crimes are well defined in common law and globally so. No amount of being disadvantaged justifies such crime. There are problems with white adjacent, self-haters, AAPI men's rights activists (goes against our own community members), Asian supremacists, Sinophobes/haters (half of AAPI are especially [Falun Gong](//t.co/anWr1FwZpk)'s [influence machine](//t.co/Uw6qcsUsUp) propels [non-credible claims](//t.co/t0kek6t0Gv) and [pro-Trump](//t.co/t1LPIOmv22) [media machine](//t.co/I1VR8i3jQP) though to be fair, [the West's media machine](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjF4GFJMRpY) is similar) / [insert Asian nation here]-o-phobes, yellow fever, etc. but again none justify any such crimes.


Q: Why are Asians yellow?

A: We're not. We [re-appropriate the term](//t.co/RD7IRrTc9z) before discarding it.


Q: Are white people the problem?

A: Many or even most white people are sympathetic to actively defending our community. See the black-related questions for more, namely, racism doesn't justify racism.


Q: Why are AAPI such easy scapegoats?

A: We've always been, but we are not and especially no longer. A more honest answer are the aforementioned about being too quiet and being blamed.


Q: Aren't blacks blaming AAPI?

A: Some do. For now, we focus on public safety priorities.


Q: Why aren't hate crime charges ever brought?

A: Only a perp explicitly stating they're racially motivated would get even a referral for prosecution much less a prosecution much less a conviction much less any sentencing.

Q: Why isn't Asians4Blacks being reciprocated?

A: Not sure. We'd love to know. Their plight is much more arduous and difficult than ours so they don't owe us but the silence is the elephant in the room. We hear it.


Q: I live in a suburb, am white adjacent, made peace with white friends / live in a black area, am black adjacent, made peace with black friends. Why should I care ruffle their feathers?

A: Threats come to all, some more than others. If they care about you, advocating for justice won't ruffle any feathers.


Q: Aren't Asians happy with their privileges?

A: We earned our voices, power, and incomes. They're not unfair as the word "privilege" presumes.


Q: Who's helping AAPI?

A: Many and we are thankful for each and every one of you.


Q: What can I do to help?

A: [Take action](/).


Q: Others have it so much worse, why aren't AAPI recognizant?

A: We totally are. All deserve the same public safety and legal protection.


Q: Who do we blame?

A: Many elements including white supremacy fostering model minority myth as if white adjacency would pacify/appease us, affirmative action proponents such as SFA used as a wedge issue in our community, other wedge issues like anti-black attempting to divide and conquer our community, historical retience to silence, external voices (like [all English-speaking China scholars being white](//twitter.com/carlzha/status/1188276177447710721) and same for [Taiwan scholars](//twitter.com/StoriesByEli/status/1316380994291859456)), history of [discriminatory laws](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act) including the only reason America ever invented "legal" immigration, etc. We will reclaim all.


Q: Why can't we just send these animals to jail?

A: _So_ many systems failed to deliver justice including bail reform, DA's (95% of whom settle cases as plea deals as they lack time, money to prosecute), law enforcement (too often refusing to even apprehend, listen, reply, everything) and we must force each failure by naming names, shaming names, withholding donors and votes and revenue, and other tactics which matter. Feckless press releases aren't useful.


Q: Where have you advertised this site?

A: Only in a few posts [here](//www.facebook.com/groups/asiansnow/permalink/3175347062498256/), [here](//www.facebook.com/CeFaanKimTV/posts/1618634198331654), and [here](//www.facebook.com/DionLimTV/posts/3730814446994126) thusfar. Quality over quantity.
