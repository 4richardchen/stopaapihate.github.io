title: Q&A, FAQ

Each one could be its own article thus [this idea to do that](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1#card-57300326). Each answer could have a copy-pastable answer as Twitter-appropriate.	

In no particular order:

**Q** How bad is it?  
**A**: Read [this list](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incidents_of_xenophobia_and_racism_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic#United_States).

Summary: 89y old Brooklyn Cantonese female set on fire unprovoked in July 2020. [Vichar Ratanapakdee](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Vicha_Ratanapakdee), 84, Oakland, Thai, male murdered unprovoked on January 28, 2021 with perp's face hidden from public reporting and grandma cheering him on. 91y old man in San Francisco Chinatown shoved from behind unprovoked [caught on video](//twitter.com/DionLimTV/status/1356098895604895745) including Antoine Watson, 19, yet District Attorney Chesa Boudin refuses to charge it as a hate crime plus the grandma used the release on bail to further disrespect the victim's family. [Ee Lee](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Ee_Lee), 36, raped, murdered in Washington Park, Milwaukee on September 19, 2020 with perps reveling in video. [Noriko Nasu](//kiro7.com/news/local/northshore-educator-seriously-injured-possible-hate-crime-attack/264KWNL3VBE5RB2KVMH6FE3H5U) attacked violently, unprovoked in Seattle's Chinatown on February 25, 2021. Only after public pressure did the police [bother to make an arrest](//komonews.com/news/local/he-was-trying-to-kill-us-says-man-in-attack-in-chinatown-international-district). Chinese man, 36, stabbed in back unprovoked in Manhattan Chinatown on February 28, 2021 by another [perp](//nextshark.com/chinatown-asian-man-stabbing-new-york/). There're 16 such reports in NYC for 2021, endless really such as [this latest](//twitter.com/CeFaanKim/status/1367168575098802182). Dozens others made local news. Latest as of writing is [this one](//abc7news.com/video-shows-attack-on-older-asian-man-in-sf-laundromat/10386627) about which few will read as most either don't want to read the news or have social media distorting their intake. Hundreds others made community private social media. Thousands (2,088 as of March 1, 2021; [3,795 as of March 17, 2021](//secureservercdn.net/104.238.69.231/a1w.90d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210312-Stop-AAPI-Hate-National-Report-.pdf)) of reports to StopAAPIHate.org. [CSHE](//www.csusb.edu/sites/default/files/FACT%20SHEET-%20Anti-Asian%20Hate%202020%203.2.21.pdf) says it's a 150% rise. Law enforcement and public prosecutors refuse to investigate or prosecute such crimes until significant media attention, and even then the judiciary is reluctant to prosecute perps of Asian victims. Right this injustice. [Blacks are only 5%](//t.co/br2lX9ssAz) of such perps ([further discussion](//twitter.com/NPRCodeSwitch/status/1376938022088933386)), so don't misplace your anger.

NYC has had these for years before with less violent but still violent assaults which "[Year of the Ox](//y2u.be/du3GbOfpHtg)" (CW: language, suicide, assault, disrespect, violence, everything the perps and their enablers brought for centuries) shows. I'll get them into a list but you see, it's LONG.

**Q** How are 3 more than 29 crimes last year that bad?  
**A1**: The oft-used [DOJ OJP](//ojp.gov) [BJS](//bjs.gov) [NCVS](//bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=91) stat of only 29 on-Asian hate crimes in 2019 is misleading in addition to [prosecutorial problems](#prosection).  
**A2**: It's a 900% uptick, a 1500% uptick, there're many categories and ways to measure it but we're unsure statistics will work given disinformation thus not spending time collecting news versus [action](/).


**Q** What's the story?  
**A**: Violent, unprovoked attacks on AAPI each 2-3 days average for a year. Reasons are unknown but may include consequences of bail reform, mental illness, [copycat syndrome](//quora.com/What-is-a-copycat-syndrome), decrease, lockdown effects (isolation, desperation, amplification of all the aforementioned), political extremism (model minority myth driven by white supremacy) may all add to the mix.

**Q** Isn't racism not a mental illness?  
**A**: It's not, but mental illness may mix with poverty, violent tendencies, poor upbringings causing further bad decision making, cultures of disrespect, glorification of violence, gun violence, etc. to motivate more such attacks. Unfortuately, legal system lets mental illness get such perps off scot-free.

**Q**: Why don't you blame white people?  
**A**: Many or even most white people are sympathetic to actively defending our community. See the black-related questions for more, namely, racism doesn't justify racism. Don't attack all white people. The problem is not white people per se which is personally offensive to so many AAPI because so many have white friends are true allies, caring, decent, and other good things, rather, that the entrenched in power use the model minority myth (we're somehow superior hard working docile people, but only when convenient) and perpetual forienger stereotype (we took American jobs when we're American ourselves, we somehow are responsible for foreign policy of a nation for whom we're not citizens, that we somehow personally took the virus over when we had no part, etc.). More racism won't solve racism. Blame all who empower, aid, and abet white supremacy including the Falun Gongers whose SafeChat app is so like Parler that white supremacists use it to fan Sinophobia, whose blinding wholesale hate of the CCP makes them responsible for fomenting anti-AAPI hate including towards themselves thus they're self-hating but they really really hate the CCP so they'll try to ignore that part, etc. Blame also super patriots like Imperial Japanese patriots, Hong Kong dissidents who're too extreme and attack anyone, Taiwanese whose purity test of anti-CCP perverts their Parliament as to exacerbate ignoring economic inequity problems thus its low birth rates (below Japan's), Vietnamese anti-CCPers who're odious, etc. Hate won't solve hate.

Reminder to check ourselves in that Asia has enough genocides, racial problems (inter and intra and in every direction), hate, discrimination, and all the problems of its own much less those within ourselves so when we criticize a whole ethnicity, we have to ready for the return fire.

**Q**: Don't Asians all look the same?  
**A**: Please, we can't even think or all achieve the same much less look the same.

**Q**: Why don't we blame black people?  
**A**: (see white people)

**Q**: Ok, to repeat, why avoid being anti-black in such work?  
**A**: Racism doesn't justify racism. No unnecessary race wars. Hate is being a terrible person so no. Don't shame yourself. More racism won't help our cause. We now know personally, deeply, what it's like to be hated, shot, killed just for being who we are.  
**More**: "[Why AAPI should care about Black Lives Matter](//www.dukechronicle.com/article/2020/06/why-asian-americans-should-care-about-black-lives-matter)" ([source](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow/permalink/4123151214384498)).

**Q**: This isn't what America is. This isn't who we are.  
**A**: It's always been America from the start. It's always been in Americans. It's what some what to be per "freedom" and what most don't want to be but might be anyways. From the earliest laws to today, we see how they endanger AAPI purposefully as designed by folks in power who know precisely what they're doing: keeping power in power. If America's about justice, then these issues will be fixed. We'll see.

**Q**: Isn't critical race theory (CRT) harming AAPI?  
**A**: (see affirmative action) CRT says our actions relative to race are due to systemic things like laws, culture, HR rules, administrative regulations outside legal purview, secrecy of NDA's covering HR cover-ups (i.e. #metoo), etc. not individual decisions so changing those unjust parts of systems will help. It doesn't have any further value. Some equity contractors like DEI/DI folk are abusing the concept for their own ends, sure.

**Q**: Aren't all the perps black?  
**A**: All are for the 13 violent crimes of 2021. I didn't write a list out but should. This problem is already worked out in very progressive circles, basically that such perps inhabit dozens of social ailments, but has no easy airing in mainstream, less progressive circles much less the oppressive ones which seek to drive a wedge. Not gonna happen.
More: "[Chinatown attacks won’t divide Black and Asian communities](//www.mercurynews.com/2021/03/03/opinion-chinatown-attacks-wont-divide-black-and-asian-communities/amp/)"


**Q**: Aren't AAPI racist, too?  
**A**: Sure, but see aforementioned.


**Q**: Why are AAPI so quiet?  
**A**: We're not quiet, see [#TheyCantBurnUsAll](//twitter.com/theycantburnusall) for a reality check about Asian America today. Model minority myth harms us so we reappropriate it for ourselves. Some were quiet because they were paying the bills as an immigrant far from home in an unfamiliar land refusing to give them rightful opportunities (we don't forget) to no fault of theirs. Others have language difficulties or don't know how America works. No more.


**Q** Do AAPI take blame?  
**A**: No, such crimes are well defined in common law and globally so. No amount of being disadvantaged justifies such crime. There are problems with white adjacent, self-haters, AAPI men's rights activists (goes against our own community members), Asian supremacists, Sinophobes/haters (half of AAPI are especially [Falun Gong](//t.co/anWr1FwZpk)'s [influence machine](//t.co/Uw6qcsUsUp) propels [non-credible claims](//t.co/t0kek6t0Gv) and [pro-Trump](//t.co/t1LPIOmv22) [media machine](//t.co/I1VR8i3jQP) though to be fair, [the West's media machine](//y2u.be/hjF4GFJMRpY) is similar) / [insert Asian nation here]-o-phobes, yellow fever, etc. but again none justify any such crimes.

Those self-hating and taking their anger out on other AAPI are most liable to say this. They're destroying not creating.


**Q**: Does this movement have credo, ethos, mission statement, about, core values? Like BLM [does](//blacklivesmatter.com/about/)?  
**A**: Yes. It's not a separate page, yet. StopAAPIHate.us stops anti-Asian attacks.

We say "stops" not "lowers" or similar because a few less won't be ok for justice.

We mean "attacks" to mean racially motivated, not that nothing bad will ever again happen to Asians as there're non-racial incidents always. Sometimes, even, Asians are the perps. Asian excellence has absolute standards.

We don't, won't use the term "hate crimes" as we know liberal public prosecutors won't ever use that term so we avoid falling into that trap.

We urge no racial animus and unnecessary race wars so hating on blacks will neither help nor be good nor reach the perps nor bring us long-term rise nor allow solidarity. One wrong warrants not another. More hate doesn't lower hate. Our mission however isn't to solve all racism, animosity, fights, hate, misunderstandings, violence, etc. It's purely as aforementioned.

We are only for solidarity when it's fair. It shall never be used to further silence, appease, placate, belittle, compare, wedge/divide, downplay, etc. us. The slightest suggestion thereof demands separation.

A mission statement is merely a shorter version of this FAQ which must exist to pre-empt, address, expand presumptions, assumptions, and accusations.

Any defense from verbal de-escalation to alertness to community watches to self-defense (martial arts derivatives) thru firearms (often requires too much training for responsible use for most folx). Firearms mostly more threat to user than help and insufficient at scale. Firearms are not quite it though it has its place when in the hands of a highly trained professional or parapro.

**Q**: Why are AAPI yellow?  
**A**: We're not. We [re-appropriate the term](//t.co/RD7IRrTc9z) before discarding it.

**Q** Why are AAPI such easy scapegoats?  
**A**: We've always been, but we are not and especially no longer. A more honest answer are the aforementioned about being too quiet and being blamed.

**Q**: Aren't blacks blaming AAPI?  
**A**: Some do. For now, we focus on public safety priorities.

**Q**: Why aren't hate crime charges ever brought? Why no [hate crime charges in burning of grandma in Brooklyn](//asamnews.com/2020/10/24/why-some-crimes-against-asian-americans-are-not-designated-hate-crimes)?  
**A**: Only a perp explicitly stating they're racially motivated would get even a referral for prosecution much less a prosecution much less a conviction much less any sentencing.  

**Q**: Why isn't Asians4Blacks/[Yellow Peril for Black Lives](//twitter.com/YP4BL) being reciprocated?  
**A**: Anyone who's seen the black outpouring in so so many ways, personal, social media, mass media, individually knows they are dominant explicit allies. Their plight is much more arduous and difficult than ours so they don't owe us. It's not their job, duty, place to have to come out but it is a good thing to do. For those who don't believe it, I'll add proof later.

**Q**: I am [non-Asian race] adjacent, made peace with [non-Asian race] friends. Why should I care ruffle their feathers?  
**A**: Threats come to all, some more than others. If they care about you, advocating for our justice won't "ruffle their feathers."

**Q**: Aren't AAPI happy with their privileges?  
**A**: We earned our voices, power, and incomes. They're not unfair as the word "privilege" presumes.

**Q**: What can I do to help?  
**A**: [Take action](/).

**Q**: Others have it so much worse, why aren't AAPI recognizant?  
**A**: We totally are. All deserve the same public safety and legal protection.

**Q**: Who do we blame?  
**A**: Many elements including white supremacy fostering model minority myth as if white adjacency would pacify/appease us, affirmative action proponents such as SFA used as a wedge issue in our community, other wedge issues like anti-black attempting to divide and conquer our community, historical retience to silence, external voices (like [all English-speaking China scholars being white](//twitter.com/carlzha/status/1188276177447710721) and same for [Taiwan scholars](//twitter.com/StoriesByEli/status/1316380994291859456)), history of [discriminatory laws](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act) including the only reason America ever invented "legal" immigration, etc. We will reclaim all.

**Q**: This isn't America. This isn't who we are.
**A**: Rock massacre, Vincent Chin, [Soon Ja Du decision](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Latasha_Harlins), 1992 LA Riots , this is America's [history](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anti-Chinese_violence_in_the_United_States) of anti-AAPI problems.

**Q**: Why can't we just send these animals to jail?  
**A**: _So_ many systems failed to deliver justice including bail reform, DA's (95% of whom settle cases as plea deals as they lack time, money to prosecute), law enforcement (too often refusing to even apprehend, listen, reply, everything) and we must force each failure by naming names, shaming names, withholding donors and votes and revenue, and other tactics which matter. Feckless press releases aren't useful.

**Q**: Where have you advertised this site?  
**A**: I posted to [AsiansNow](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow/permalink/3175347062498256/), [CeFaan Kim](//facebook.com/CeFaanKimTV/posts/1618634198331654), [Dion Lim](//facebook.com/DionLimTV/posts/3730814446994126), [Andrew Yang at XFF](//facebook.com/andrewyang2021/posts/1405749266431033), and again to [CeFaan Kim](//facebook.com/CeFaanKimTV/posts/1619437188251355) and [again yet](//facebook.com/CeFaanKimTV/posts/1618106261717781).
