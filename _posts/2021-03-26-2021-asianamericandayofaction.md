title: March 26 Day of Action
---

March 26 will always be a day of action so that there's a focus for ongoing efforts after the Atlanta (and Acworth) murders of 6 Asian women. We will never forget.

To collect the still disparate organizing as it's not centralized:
* [National Day of Action and Healing](//twitter.com/CAAM/status/1375476371292626953)
* AARN: [wear black](https://twitter.com/MsTrangTruong/status/1365180837176737792)
* merely the widely used hashtag #StopAsianHate [isn't specific enough](//twitter.com/ChrisLu44/status/1369414348486086659)
* [Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtnviewellen/status/1374478961929949191) to [GDoc](https://t.co/dIxGz0KsG9?amp=1) and [site](//t.co/86b4o40GfH)
  * it's March 26 because its the anniversary of the Naturalization Act of 1790 which restricted US citizenship by naturalization to white immigrants until 1952
