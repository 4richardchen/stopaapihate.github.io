The problem is not white people which is personally offensive to so many AAPI because so many have white friends are true allies, caring, decent, and other good things, rather, that the entrenched in power use the model minority myth (we're somehow superior hard working docile people, but only when convenient) and perpetual forienger stereotype (we took American jobs when we're American ourselves, we somehow are responsible for foreign policy of a nation for whom we're not citizens, that we somehow personally took the virus over when we had no part, etc.). More racism won't solve racism. Blame all who empower, aid, and abet white supremacy including the Falun Gongers whose SafeChat app is so like Parler that white supremacists use it to fan Sinophobia, whose blinding wholesale hate of the CCP makes them responsible for fomenting anti-AAPI hate including towards themselves thus they're self-hating but they really really hate the CCP so they'll try to ignore that part, etc.
