Welcome to my first daily roundup.

[CNN](//www.cnn.com/2021/03/08/media/alexi-mccammond-teen-vogue/index.html), _[Fashion Weekly](//fashionweekdaily.com/new-teen-vogue-eic-alexi-mccammond-slammed-over-resurfaced-racist-tweets/?fbclid=IwAR1qh_08PZeOslXb_ayyq9k0dVjwueIzMRL-JL8IhtQ7MdgC9kOYG2dgHqw)_, [cupsterette](//instagram.com/p/CMIKWZegh4n/?utm_source=ig_embed) (_The Infatuation_'s editor Diana Tsui), et al. cover Conde Nast's new Teen Vogue Editor-in-Chief's racist anti-Asian Tweets.
Opinion: That she's a POC gives her zero cover. Don't think she needs to be fired, rather, to acknowledge though we know CN's history of pandering to Asians means their PR remains intentionally mute. Threatening their advertising revenue is the only useful tactic, see slpg_giants.
