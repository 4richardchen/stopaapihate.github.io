I put daily crimes into [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia_and_racism_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic?action=edit&section=71#United_States) for better centralizing, vetting, visibility, formatting, and overall orderliness.

Horrible news of another mass shooting with a [racial motivation](//twitter.com/Mont_Jiang/status/1372057905567047682/photo/1) which gets to how this site has such a long list of things people can do to #StopAAPIHate. The incident mixes so many social ails:
* shooter allegedly [went out hunting for Chinese](//twitter.com/Mont_Jiang/status/1372057905567047682/photo/1)
* solidarity with blacks as AAPI realize the violence levied at/against, by, in, around blacks (I don't say African Americans because so many blacks are not from or actively relating to Africa) is the same as for us; recognize that racial animus is bottomless
* sexual violence
  * must note that half the victims weren't Asian but were mostly female
* gun violence
  * lobbying with dark money
* media poo-poo-ing the shooter as not that bad, having a bad day, just wanting a rub, whatever and then newsroom rules removing the victim's racial elements as if we don't actually know yet that rule silences the victims which the for profit mass mainstream media system requires
  * AAJA is trying but what we really need is all journalism to recognize their own problems which thru the Drumpf era didn't teach them anything
* with such spas, possible issues:
  * Asians enslaving, trafficking, owning Asians
  * overseas debts lenders, scammers forcing such work
  * human trafficking, sex trade, legal (including prosecutorial, law enforcement, etc.) problems entrapping victims 
* real estate problems where false presumptions about an area's poverty (easy abusing) or affluence (revenge for their perceived ill-gotten gains) makes for more abuse
* model minority myth making it seem as if it's so shocking that Asian women could be poor, forced into unwanted work, into degrading roles that it silences victims 
* silence, you know who you are (probably not you if you're reading) because we all know who's complicit, silent
* unwanted impressions of massage parlors which are at least misunderstanding AAPI, at worst stereotyping AAPI thus forcing others' words over ours
