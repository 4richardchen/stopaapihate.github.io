Vigil [last night in Philadelphia](https://www.facebook.com/events/1095563770961182).

Here's how to stop that Sheriff's Jay Baker from blaming the victims for the shooter's "having a bad day" because that's a dog whistle to his kind that they'll protect the shooter:
1. Leave a message for [@CherokeeSO](//twitter.com/sherokeeso) Lt. Will Ballard, Investigations head, at [678-493-4317](https://www.cherokeega-sheriff.org/?page_id=458) (switchboard is 678-493-4100) saying:

    I call about the case of suspect Robert Aaron Long. Officer Baker said the suspect has a sex addiction. Survillance video in the office's hands but already known to the Korean community has the suspect saying, "Kill all the Asians" on video. Blaming the shooting on sex addiction is not justice. Blame the racially motivated sexually charged shooter not his "having a bad day. Public trust in law enforcement decreased when you blame the suspect's "having a bad day". Sheriff's office is in the public eye.

    Sheriff Jay Baker is [off the case](//twitter.com/NicoleFCarr/status/1372627341457907714) but remains on the force. Call Cherokee Sheriff's HR's Liz Stringer 678-4963-4128, Operations' Joe Satterfield 678-493-4130, Prof. Standards' Bave Barone 678-493-4116, Investigations' 678-493-4317 with the script: "Sheriffs cannot have public trust when they're found to personally hate Asian Americans for being the virus when they are not. Lack of public trust endangers justice, law, law enforcement, and all society. Remove Sheriff Baker."
