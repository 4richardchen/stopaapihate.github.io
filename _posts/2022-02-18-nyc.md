First, a moment of silence for Christina Yuna Lee.

Thank you.

Per the recent murder of Christina Yuna Lee, I share this usually private write-up (circulated usually only in emails and locked up GDocs) to get direct action on the issue of public safety directly effecting all Americans, not just those similar in profile. Skip to action.

# Media
It's their perception of reality that's often reality, but ignore mass mainstream media who don't care given they're for-profit ad revenue shareholder driven.

and note those who're silent

At the bottom by design are some comments as you write is background to inform your anger, advocacy, and action.

Real urgency requires one avoid usual problems including excess partisanship, friendly fire (one side firing on itself just because they're angry not because of any real policy disagreements), self-defeating arguments (circular ones which have no end), excess racial politics (unknown racial motivation though anyone can ascertain the effect that racial tropes, stereotypes would influence perpertrators thus worries about copy cats and the standard American levels of violence), etc.

Crime is a very complex issue involving too many social ails as to prevent useful action. All use these arguments to lock up effective action

Lots of angry forces include less credible ones like men's rights, anti-America Americans (born here but deeply resentful as to use super patriotism abroad), etc.) use this moment to freely rip Asian America apart. Goal is to improve public safety. Many routes, one goal.
