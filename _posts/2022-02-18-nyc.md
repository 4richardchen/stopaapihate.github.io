title: Christina Yuna Lee

First, a moment of silence for Christina Yuna Lee.

Thank you.

For the few/none who don't know the story, it's a [shocking murder](//fb.watch/bghQioE3Zo/) (content warning: everything).

Per the recent murder of Christina Yuna Lee, I share this usually private write-up (circulated usually only in emails and locked up GDocs) to get direct action on the issue of public safety directly effecting all Americans, not just those similar in profile. Skip to action. Skip to [new tactics](//twitter.com/Mont_Jiang/status/1494738333062385666).

## Be Safe
Street safety includes the popular [Safety Resources For Asians in America](https://t.co/LryLQE116U)

Get allies

We're 4-12% of the population depending on methodology so we need allies to grow power, voice.

# Media
It's their perception of reality that's often reality, but ignore mass mainstream media who don't care given they're for-profit ad revenue shareholder driven.

Eliminate the stereotype that we're weak, docile, voiceless, model minority myth, inhuman (Sinophobia, "all look alike" feed in) by ruining them directly wherever you see them in life. For more pointed howto,

Name, list, skip those who're silent. Skip all threats to the cause: multiple electds with too many mapping of districts, jurisdictions, agencies, offices, donors, donor networks, etc. Stick to ideals: non-partisan (ha!), non-issue (safety is right not issue), fully public (no private politics/docs), history-agnostic

Todo: check the list: Niou (NYAD65 Chinatown), Lee (NYCCD23 Qns E), Ung (NYCCD20 Flushing), Liu (NYSD11 Elmhurst), Kim (NYAD40), Marte (NYCCD01 Chinatown), Hanif (NYCCD39 Park Slope), Singh (NYCCD32 Bk Bed-Stuy), Krishnan (NYCCD25 Elmhurst), Won (NYCCD26 Woodside)

## Enforce Law Enforcement
Todo: skip problems of some orgs like Blue Lives Matter, which ideally, would raise public trust by ensuring the swift enforcement of public order and trust; instead they are co-opted by tons of horrible ilk who flaunt officer safety, public trust and order, investigative integrity, the literal enforcement of law, omsbudsman/offiecer integrity, referrals to prosection, or the historical and current realities of policing.

# Commentary
At the bottom by design are some comments as you write is background to inform your anger, advocacy, and action.

Real urgency requires one avoid usual problems including excess partisanship, friendly fire (one side firing on itself just because they're angry not because of any real policy disagreements), self-defeating arguments (circular ones which have no end), excess racial politics (unknown racial motivation though anyone can ascertain the effect that racial tropes, stereotypes would influence perpertrators thus worries about copy cats and the standard American levels of violence), etc.

Crime is a very complex issue involving too many social ails as to prevent useful action. All use these arguments to lock up effective action. Skip the complexity.

Lots of angry forces include less credible ones like opinion influencers, men's rights, anti-America Americans (born here but deeply resentful as to use super patriotism abroad), etc.) use this moment to tout own brands but collateral damage is further dividing an already too small Asian America with well known factions into further smaller voices. Goal is to improve public safety. Many routes, one goal?

Unfortunately, most coverage comes from the biased NYC tabloids [NY Daily News](https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/posts/10158529528592541?__cft__[0]=AZXJMh8J0RUkgjEjHfE7aSVYGLPmCHpfD0z49Cw_8OJx8P0EWnoiTGIQt-bzvRhJCXV6B0wc5MNC2ZPblX40_fXKUXVEY4WCUXVqljmMVUTG_IeeUsSK6W4whabc24Y-fhI&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R). Notice how NBC Asian America and the usual mainstream folks beyond the NYC tv stations were loudly silent.

Likewise, disallow those using it to hate on blacks. The perpertrator's race is no/unreliable/inaccurate prejudice against all of the race.
