title: History of Anti-Asian Hate
---

Inspired by [Beau's explanation](//y2u.be/rFbHml5ba0M)'s (13:13), I have edited and will continue to edit these articles, and you should, too:
* [Xenophobia and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic](//t.co/ZjhkbXa6OG) especially New York
* [Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States](//t.co/U4sKrjWS4b)
   * [Anti-Chinese legislation in the United States](//t.co/xCQVSzLgyj)

Todo:
* most media outlets erase our history from their platforms, transition to somewhere else protected, our own, censor-free
    * add material from [Densho Project](//t.co/ikb4bSWs2x)
    * related: [public list of incidents](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1#card-61036104)
    * Sinophobia for all history especially lately, 45's "China virus" and similar tropes, KKK hunting Vietnamese in 1980s, LA riots of 1992, and then this recent era where literally nearly daily a violent on-Asian attack is on social media, even if it rarely ever makes mass mainstream media. The American problems of butterfly syndrome, dragon lady, lotus blossom, yellow peril, model minority myth, and perpetual foreigner syndrome are all as old as America.
    * History as heard on [ep130](//t.co/cgNkMm3S6W)
* edit [Asian American movement](//bitly.com/2rR0ZaK), [Asian American Activism](//t.co/IdzlAcWTDu)
* turn this into some education worthy thing since lesson plans follow some format unknown to outsiders of education but which is required for education administrators to accept it
* propel Asian American History Month in academia, schools
    * agree on an institutional-acceptable version
    * list educational places, forums, [TeachersPayTeachers](//t.co/SuTZkBo4Kn), etc.
* propel public but less political awareness
    * read Philadelphia City Councilmember David Oh's [resolution](//t.co/CWFpqTyL2K); [tell him](//twitter.com/DavidOhPhilly/status/1382838911588794372) when done
* list, shame opponents; invariably, some "teachers" will oppose it and they deserve to be put onto a public list
