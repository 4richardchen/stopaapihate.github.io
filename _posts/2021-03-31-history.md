title: History of Anti-Asian Hate
---

Inspired by [Beau's explanation](//y2u.be/rFbHml5ba0M)'s (13:13), I have edited and will continue to edit these articles, and you should, too:
* [Xenophobia and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic](//t.co/ZjhkbXa6OG) especially New York
* [Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States](//t.co/U4sKrjWS4b)
   * [Anti-Chinese legislation in the United States](//t.co/xCQVSzLgyj)

Todo:
* most media outlets erase our history from their platforms, transition to somewhere else protected, our own, censor-free
    * add material from [Densho Project](//t.co/ikb4bSWs2x)
    * related: [public list of incidents](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io/projects/1#card-61036104)
* edit [Asian American movement](//bitly.com/2rR0ZaK), [Asian American Activism](//t.co/IdzlAcWTDu)
* turn this into some education worthy thing since lesson plans follow some format unknown to outsiders of education but which is required for education administrators to accept it
* propel Asian American History Month in academia, schools
    * agree on an institutional-acceptable version
    * list educational places, forums, [TeachersPayTeachers](//t.co/SuTZkBo4Kn), etc.
* propel public but less political awareness
    * read Philadelphia City Councilmember David Oh's [resolution](//t.co/CWFpqTyL2K); [tell him](//twitter.com/DavidOhPhilly/status/1382838911588794372) when done
* list, shame opponents; invariably, some "teachers" will oppose it and they deserve to be put onto a public list
