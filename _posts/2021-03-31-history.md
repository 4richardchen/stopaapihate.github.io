title: History of Anti-Asian Hate
---

Inspired by [Beau's explanation](//y2u.be/rFbHml5ba0M)'s (13:13), I have edited and will continue to edit these articles:
* [Xenophobia and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic](//t.co/ZjhkbXa6OG)
* [Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States](//t.co/U4sKrjWS4b)

Help me edit if you can.

Misc commentary not fit for Wikipedia: "This isn't America" means "this isn't who we hope to be but are". "We are better than this" means "we aren't better, yet".

Todo:
* propel this to educational places, forums, [TeachersPayTeachers](//t.co/SuTZkBo4Kn), etc.
* turn this into some education worthy thing since lesson plans follow some format unknown to outsiders of education but which is required for education administrators to accept it
* propel Asian American History Month in academia, schools
  * read Philadelphia City Councilmember David Oh's [resolution](//t.co/CWFpqTyL2K); [tell him](//twitter.com/DavidOhPhilly/status/1382838911588794372) when done
* list those who contest, oppose us because invariably, some teachers will oppose it and they deserve to be put onto a public list
