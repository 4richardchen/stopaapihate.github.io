Inspired by [Beau's explanation](//youtube.com/watch?v=rFbHml5ba0M)'s, I present a history of AAPI hate.

The tired "this isn't America" means "this isn't who we hope to be but are". The tired "we are better than this" means "we didn't try much for centuries".

Todo:
* propel this to educational places, forums, [TeachersPayTeachers](//t.co/SuTZkBo4Kn), etc.
* turn this into some education worthy thing since lesson plans follow some format unknown to outsiders of education but which is required for education administrators to accept it
* propel Asian American History Month in academia, schools
* list those who contest, oppose us because invariably, some teachers will oppose it and they deserve to be put onto a public list
