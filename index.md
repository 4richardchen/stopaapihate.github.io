Read a [simpler version of this page](//t.co/f8iWLI8kuU) ([Tweet](//twitter.com/joeyng/status/1362922187611537408)); [summary](//facebook.com/invisibleasians/posts/103494218467377); [Facebook singular post](//facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10160909652963135&set=a.10150625334458135); [link list](//t.co/UiClM97MOj) ([alt](//bit.ly/aapilove)); an [explanation](//nextshark.com/anti-asian-assaults-racism-may-lee); or below.

All media profits from tracking user engagement to sell advertising access. Exploit it for your benefit. It's not "AI". It's advertising data haul.

Facebook Groups:
* [Asians Today](//facebook.com/groups/asianstoday) — raises social awareness in the Asian diaspora
    * [Asians Today: Food & Cuisine](//facebook.com/groups/1372490049510148) - by far most active of its many sub-groups: [Politics](//facebook.com/groups/asianstodaypolitics), [AAPI](//facebook.com/groups/asianstodayasianamericans), [Health & Fitness](//facebook.com/groups/asianstodayhealthandfitness)
* [The #StopAsianHate To Do List](//facebook.com/groups/2671020096466397) - focuses on action
* [Stop Racism Against Asian Americans](//facebook.com/groups/2527967444134996) - more empathy and heart and optimism; founded by Adam Manhbaoboua who’s very empathetic himself
* [Asian Americans United Against Violence](//facebook.com/groups/240524854010441) (AAUAV) - emphasizes quicker, more aggressive justice and anger against perps — run by TaeWoo Kim, a strident defender of the community and well known in LA
* [Asian Equal Rights](//facebook.com/groups/asian.equal.rights) (AER) - excellent coverage of Chinese American social affairs especially foreign policy; stems from a Northeastern Queens group; run by excellent principled cool admins
* [Living While Asian](//facebook.com/groups/hateagainstasian) - changing AAPI media (especially journalism) representation; founded, actively moderated by all-stars in the field
* [Voices of Chinatown](//facebook.com/groups/ctusa) - reliable quick coverage of violence, public safety
* [Crimes Against Asians](//facebook.com/groups/crimesagainstasians) - was a super-popular private group, now less popular with a gap July 2020 to April 2021 due to bad news burnout; run by NextShark with the same clickbait model and approving primarily their own content
* [Asian Americans (& allies ) VS the Model Minority Myth](//facebook.com/groups/792343574185384) — specializes in fighting the model minority myth — run by Errol Lam and I
* [Asians Not Brainwashed By Media Lapping Up Amy Chua (ANBM-LUAC)](//facebook.com/groups/420895108043294) - excellent quality curation of Asian American history, arts, and less political more advocacy — run by a friend, the Brooklyn-based artist Akiko Ichikawa; not to be confused with the similarly named [Asians Not Brainwashed by Media - Official Group (ANBM)](//facebook.com/groups/anbmsource) which starts off seemingly innocently for the community but is a men's rights free-for-all
* [Global Asians for Action and Social Change](//facebook.com/groups/GlobalAsians) (GAASC) - focused on actionable social change — run by very principled all-stars, but perhaps too sedate for this era
* [API Hate Crimes & Equity Initiatives](//facebook.com/groups/822050604959359) (AHCEI) — positive advocacy, including writing to encourage AAPI electeds — run by Yun-Sook Kim, an experienced LA-based community leader, and I
* [Unity: Strength in Numbers](//facebook.com/groups/58419352884917) — positive news — founded by Nina Koo, a reliable NYC/SGV organizer, and Linda Chan; moderated by other veteran NYC organizers

Bad groups:
* [Asian American Alliance Against Racism (AAAAR)](//facebook.com/groups/142455397210001) - rampant, intentional, toxic, infighting, a open brawl, free-for-all as admins remain hands-off to let everyone fight it out except when the admins' sense of control is threatened then no-warning removals ensue en masse; they reap the chaos they sowed; as such, they've been co-opted by the aforementioned groups as they've banned so many 100s of users; while they've removed the famously abusive, angry [Nancy Chen](//facebook.com/nancy.chenebury), [Annie Sin](//facebook.com/annie.sin.568) remains
* [AsiansNOW](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow) - power-hungry admins, notably [Tuan H. Nguyen](//facebook.com/tuannguyen42), who ban members for small infractions of their excessive rules born out of too many hateful times they couldn't moderate; headed same way as AAAAR

Analysis: All media orgs, social or chat apps or mainstream or whatever, use algorithms to max data haul. As such, they may anti-Asian American hate news. Media use (app, web, messengers, anything) tracks user engagement (not just clicks, but lingers, scrolls, edits, etc.) for big data, sales (of data access not the data itself which is more useful kept native), and advertiser dollars.

## Help victims
### Patrol, Guard, Watch, Protect, Defend, Intervene

Help the victim(s) in real time. Train to avoid shock, delay, silence. It's not illegal to use force in self-defense. Train in [firearms](//t.co/DgmItFWXAj), weapons (umbrellas, pepper spray, bear spray, belts, hammers, etc.), martial arts, [self-defense](//youtube.com/watch?v=woL9f-R-OTs&list=PLewDws3GRrGgnx6bneWAXJvm9K3mJ98TS&index=1).

### Report Crimes
[StopAAPIHate.org](//t.co/tjHqwy28HY) is de facto reporting as run by [A3PCon](//t.co/2IIhw7taKo), et al. They've a [$10M](//t.co/zIrrsYIxqX)+[$1M](//t.co/tGnrakbeMy) budget thus can [stay relevant](//linktr.ee/stopaapihate). [OCA](//t.co/eNTNYoHB4z) stopped [AAPIHateCrimes](//t.co/yX5ogNiir4) in 2018. AAAJ's [Stand Against Hatred](//t.co/xTA3ZWrxZ4) is informal and leads to [more](//t.co/fzkiZWQ89I)

Victims often won't report crimes due to language difficulty, cultural shame for causing attention, and/or fear of inconvenience. Attackers have openly stated they intentionally target such victims and often commit crime to exert power. Reporting removes their power. Bystanders, get video and [report](//stopaapihate.org/reportincident).

in-language: [HateCrimeBook](//t.co/xFmQcABL79)

Media review:
1. ''[PlanA Magazine](//t.co/QXxjHpSVqT)'' is next level social awareness. 
1. Benny Luo's [NextShark](//twitter.com/NextShark) is clickbait whose [credibility](//twitter.com/eugenegu/status/1358846497861718018) threatens the cause, but has very high visibility. Some contributors are individually more credible such as [May Lee](//t.co/NUdbR2XXPD) of [The May Lee Show](//twitter.com/TheMayLeeShow) though they share in the attention.
1. _[Asian Dawn](//twitter.com/tattoo__audist/status/1273865754752868353)_ foments hate namely against blacks for a goal unknown, whether to divide and conquer, create general chaos, go for clickbait, get media attention, be anti-black, or what. They're full of controversy regardless. Similarly problematic are adherants like [stopkillingasians](//instagram.com/stopkillingasians).
1. [Asian Rise](//instagram.com/asian__rise) has Asian Dawn's problems plus JackFroot's near same content; their former [Asian Rise](//instagram.com/asian_rise) got deleted as portents poorly
1. [JackFroot](//linktr.ee/Jackfroot) by [Davian Nguyen](//instagram.com/daviannguyen) is a bit less reactive but similar clickbait, so fast to the draw as to be erroneous a few times already which endangers its credibility
1. NBCAsianAmerica downplayed and ignored anti-AAPI incidents for years, has only 2 writers, and [deleted Yang](//twitter.com/hashtag/MSNBCfearsYang regardless.
1. Anonymous outlets like [Asian Lives Matter](//youtube.com/channel/UC6cWZcuD9kNnuaWAoIeDibg) and [ANTI-PC ASIAN VLOG](//youtube.com/channel/UCt4NUInb_cw8-nqpLoJaaXQ) have too many problems. For example, the latter's include debunked accusations of pedophilia, using model minority myth to its ploy, extreme political biases, propelling human rights abuses, etc.
1. [Mainstream and for-profit media ignore Asians](//thecrimson.com/article/2021/2/25/conde-media-coverage-asian-america-issues) as their sole goal, clicks for profit, is not ours.

## Storytell
Telling your story empowers you, the silent, and our community (i.e. [#metoo](//twitter.com/hashtag/metoo)). Special note to tell the stories of our elders.

And speak about it. Here's [one way how](//y2u.be/204lTCAr2nw).

Users using [#StopAAPIHate](//twitter.com/hashtag/StopAAPIHate) for personal agendas, latching onto the movement, but dedicated to unhelpful goals: [mfbt](//twitter.com/mfbt) (excessively divisive, needlessly inflamatory, excessively reactive), [InterArma](//twitter.com/Mont_Jiang) (pro-CCP); [Amanda](//twitter.com/catcontentonly) (willfully fires on anyone, especially non-Communists; [kratom](//t.co/Crwrb1yopX) proponent); [Ok Baizuo](//twitter.com/Ok_Baizuo/status/1387196722892378113) which shows Chinese state media view; [1900 Institute](//y2u.be/CNRcluK2-XI) who wants to influence US-CN relations

Users who're mostly for #StopAAPIHate but too extreme to be reliable, credible per se: [Casey Ho](//twitter.com/CaseyHo) (sharply strict as to offend general allies),

This is different than reporting crimes since it's longer, not necessarily about a crime, and can be fiction. This is different than media as it's about our stories not others' stories.

## Media
Represent not just in the entertainment industry (see [Nancy Wang Yuen](//t.co/43HC1QkOFX)) and journalism ([political journalists](//twitter.com/i/lists/1231328521475231745), [AAPI journalists](//twitter.com/i/lists/87671182)), but all public life outlets.

Screens, Movies, Television: [tv lead list](//t.co/jqXwzgq9YN); ''Moxie'' (2021) features the all-AAPI rock band [The Linda Lindas](//y2u.be/1Eg3c9i1Am0) ([credit](//instagram.com/p/COORUKZAY8T); [intro](//y2u.be/wNTgy6cm_-Y); [#MoxieGirlsFightBack](//twitter.com/hashtag/moxiegirlsfightback); [its book](//t.co/Nbya7xacOr))

For casting opportunities, industry email groups are best. Barely any get reposted to [groups actively keeping up with the news](//medium.com/@richardc020/washthehate-43cb5d0de773?source=friends_link&sk=d488ff5071ef42d7c1b99034288d8421).

## Get Justice
Do so in a way that doesn’t perpetuate more racism, hate, poverty, inequity (not the kind that eliminates grades, rather, the kind that allows for real merit, a tricky idea to implement), oppression by the unfairly empowered, etc. Bail reform lets perps in recent crimes back onto streets within hours of apprehension, but not all Democratic Party movements are wrong. Reform such imprecise legal efforts. Follow others' playbooks. Judicial change and legal reform is endless: victimization of victims, law enforcement only enforces laws which are themselves ignorant to intentionally designed to silence AAPI victims, inability of high barrier to hate crime legal definition convictions, etc. Lawmaking rarely minds AAPI.

## Be Civicly Involved
The IRS designation for traditional non-profits and community groups is 501(c)(3) and legally forbids their political involvement with campaigns or candidates but the threat is vague thus they stay intentionally mute, fearful, and avoidant to avoid being taxed. Some orgs start a related 527/501(c)(4) organization to do political advocacy, else, they'll defend their IRS tax-free designation.

## Get Educated
Many even AAPI, socially involved people don't know the history, lessons, and news about this topic. [Read the history](history). Acknowledge how white supremacy and capitalism pit racial groups against one another for the pie scraps when could grow the pie.

### Advoacate, Pressure, Lobby, Influence
Increase local resources for mental health, corrections (not mere incarceration for for-profit contractors), prosecution, law enforcement (they need public trust), local and community policing (PD's aren't only about SWAT and counterterrorism though also important), improved lawmaking process (legislation happens at all levels involving all citizenry), community participation in all the aforementioned.

### Help Electeds
Volunteer for them because they do so much needing help including constituent services, media/PR/spokespersons/syndicates, outreach, legal research, writing, legislative coalition building, community affairs/relations, etc. Their campaigns are separate but needed orgs, too.

### Participate, Engage
Civil rhetoric is lacking, decline in political candidates' moderation and compassion and compromise sills,  worsening political choices, increasing political extremism, etc. all threaten the American political process. Insist, enforce, and encourage proper candor. Idealistic but necessary else the world burns.

I made a [list of Facebook groups](//medium.com/@richardc020/washthehate-43cb5d0de773?source=friends_link&sk=d488ff5071ef42d7c1b99034288d8421).

### Include Other Leaders
Build solidarity with other politically involved entities: faith leaders, prospective candidates (court opponents [#YangGang](//twitter.com/hashtag/yanggang) style), etc. and with other racially oppressed groups (BLM, NAACP, [Brady Campaign](//facebook.com/bradycampaign), etc.)

Learn, teach the origins of racial diviseness and specific ethnic histories in the U.S. Talk to family members. You can choose your approach from far-left's [but-they're-just-acting-out](//medium.com/@kmttran/talking-to-my-non-black-asian-mom-about-property-destruction-64092062adc8) way to the [LettersForBlackLives](//docs.google.com/document/d/10syOzyDfJfmw9Bg89cam8wj29sa_rJHoDXFbrhrFJLs) (awesome open collaboration) to a [comics approach](//lettersforblacklives.com/letters-for-black-lives-comic-edition-d840921c0141).

## Build Solidarity through Intersectionality
There're thousands of allied shared orgs, movements, causes, groups, and allies in so many areas, notably arts, cultural, ethnics, and social movements who've been doing related work for years, too. They might intersect more with your existing, deeper interests.

### Education
Education (not just public, but all) is inherently a social movement.

Todo: sign [NYC AAPI History](//t.co/10XIK9c0gW); add AAPI history to curricula (very hard as every municipality and textbook deciding organ is highly fragmented), add Lunar New Year to holidays
