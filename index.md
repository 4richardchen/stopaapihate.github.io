# What _you_ can do About anti-Asian Hate

## Be, Stay Informed
Most have an idea. Fewer have details. Yet fewer have real-time news. [Track the hate](//twitter.com/RachelRoh), especially in [social media](//stopaapihate.org/reportsreleases), join [groups actively informed](//medium.com/@richardc020/washthehate-43cb5d0de773?source=friends_link&sk=d488ff5071ef42d7c1b99034288d8421) ([this tag](//facebook.com/groups/1450447971654849/post_tags/?post_tag_id=1956436984389276) is a list), or read a [summary](//facebook.com/invisibleasians/posts/103494218467377) or [an explanation of why we're taking action](//nextshark.com/anti-asian-assaults-racism-may-lee).

## Help victims
### Intervene

Help the victim in real time. Train to avoid shock, delay, silence. It's not illegal to use force in self-defense. Train in [firearms](//nrainstructors.org/search.aspx), other weaponry, martial arts, [self-defense](//youtube.com/watch?v=woL9f-R-OTs&list=PLewDws3GRrGgnx6bneWAXJvm9K3mJ98TS&index=1). 

Orgs: [Hollaback!](//twitter.com/iHollaback), [IMPACT](//facebook.com/IMPACTselfdefense), [Smart Defense](//elizabethsmartfoundation.org/smart-defense); [East Bay Toishan Association](//nbcbayarea.com/news/local/new-oakland-chinatown-foot-patrol-forms-to-protect-asian-american-community/2481091); [Guardian Angels](//facebook.com/guardianangels.org), [CAENY](//facebook.com/CAENYC), [Oakland Compassion Project](//oakcompassionproject.org), [API Healer Network](//nqapia.org/wpp/healthandhealing), [City of New York](//www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/community/stop-asian-hate.page), [Chicago CMA](//facebook.com/cmaachicago), [Project Lotus](//facebook.com/projectlotusorg), local patrols and [neighbor watches](//nnw.org), [NYPD volunteering](//www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/administrative/programs.page), [asiangunsociety](//instagram.com/p/CL5FV1xDCHb)

### Report Crimes
[StopAAPIHate.org](//t.co/tjHqwy28HY) is the de facto crime reporting as run by [A3PCon](//t.co/2IIhw7taKo) taking over where [OCA](//t.co/eNTNYoHB4z) stopped with [AAPIHateCrimes](//t.co/yX5ogNiir4) in 2018.

Victims often won't report crimes due to language difficulty, cultural shame for causing attention, and/or fear of inconvenience. Attackers have openly stated they intentionally target such victims and often commit crime to exert power. Reporting helps to remove their power. Bystanders: get video and [report](//stopaapihate.org/reportincident).

For confidential reporting with public reporting and protected anonymity (i.e. not _NY Post_ who unethically, unwantedly outed [Lauren Kwei](//www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-emt-lauren-kwei-1103336) who [reappropriated her name and fame](//rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-medic-lauren-kwei-new-york-post-interview-1104943)), see [Dion Lim](//facebook.com/DionLimTV) and [Betty Yu](//facebook.com/BettyYuLive) in SF, [CeFaan Kim](//facebook.com/CeFaanKimTV) and [Vicky Nguyen](//t.co/H1idgZnvam) in NYC, Randall Yip at [AsAmNews](//facebook.com/AsAmNews), et al.

For [#metoo](//twitter.com/hashtag/metoo) related, see [TimesUp Help](//t.co/878xO8wRJv) or [Emily Chang](//facebook.com/emilychangbloomberg), author of _[Broptopia](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotopia)_. [AAJA](//facebook.com/aaja) has tons more; not all are as outspoken (I've a [list](//twitter.com/i/lists/82469881)).

[HateCrimeBook](//t.co/xFmQcABL79) is succinct howto in many languages.

Warnings on Benny Luo's [NextShark](//twitter.com/NextShark) which is problematic clickbait whose [credibility](//twitter.com/eugenegu/status/1358846497861718018) threatens the cause; _Asian Dawn_ which willfully foments hate; [NBCAsianAmerica](//twitter.com/nbcasianamerica) which downplayed, ignored incidents for years, has only 2 writers, and its relative MSNBC [deleted Yang](//twitter.com/hashtag/MSNBCfearsYang); and that [most media ignore Asians](//thecrimson.com/article/2021/2/25/conde-media-coverage-asian-america-issues).

## Storytell
Telling your story adds to the power. Witness the empowerment of [#metoo](//twitter.com/hashtag/metoo).

It's different than reporting crimes since it's longer, not necessarily about a crime, and can be fictional.

### Find Allies
You've got to stay sane. Find those rowing in the same direction. I made a [list of Facebook groups](//medium.com/@richardc020/washthehate-43cb5d0de773?source=friends_link&sk=d488ff5071ef42d7c1b99034288d8421).

### Represent in Media
Media includes not just entertainment industry (see [Nancy Wang Yuen](//t.co/43HC1QkOFX)) and journalism ([political journalists](//twitter.com/i/lists/1231328521475231745), [AAPI journalists](//twitter.com/i/lists/87671182)), but all public life outlets.

For casting opportunities, industry email groups are best. Some make it to [groups actively keeping up with the news](//medium.com/@richardc020/washthehate-43cb5d0de773?source=friends_link&sk=d488ff5071ef42d7c1b99034288d8421).

### Literature: Bookstores
There're just a few: [Eastwind, Berekely, CA](//asiabookcenter.com), [Philippines Expressions, San Pedro, CA](//yelp.com/biz/philippine-expressions-bookshop-san-pedro).

### Literature: Authors
I made a [list](//twitter.com/i/lists/1192831042706694149) of the many. Particularly outspoken is [Viet Thanh Nguyen](//t.co/5g1NkoOJ0B).

### Travel
So many. [Start here](//t.co/cTOZ7tHBVd).

### Military
So many. [Start here](//instagram.com/ddooonnnn). For the unfamiliar, Filipinos in the US military service is a huge long tradition steeped in history. See a [salute](//youtube.com/watch?v=pLq_07REniY).

### Food, Culinary
Insanity. [Martin Yan](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoHdVwXDgCI)

## Support AAPI Businesses
[Start here](//news.yahoo.com/8-asian-owned-beauty-brands-110000728.html); [asiansofcreation](//instagram.com/asiansofcreation)

Yelp, the leading business review service, could use a feature like their much-touted [black-owned businesses](//blog.yelp.com/2020/06/yelp-teams-up-with-my-black-receipt-to-support-black-owned-businesses).

## Get Justice
Do so in a way that doesn’t perpetuate more racism, hate, mass incarceration culture, etc. Bail reform let the perps in recent crimes back to the streets which isn't to say all Democratic Party movements are wrong. Reform such imprecise legal efforts. Follow their playbook.

### Translate
Get “language justice” and in-language access at all levels. Volunteer your translation skill.

### Disaggregate Data
Because not breaking out Asian data leads to the model minority myth as if we're all the richest, most white adjacent, harmless, docile, obedient worker bees. [#NotYourModelMinority](//twitter.com/hashtag/NotYourModelMinority)

Orgs: [AAPIData](//t.co/UcKelpUGIQ)

## Raise Awareness
Those outside of the community need to know. Tell them. Social media is the key. One-on-one even better. In person even better for better communication. Don't preach to the choir. Reach those outside of self-selecting environments like those listed here.

## Be Civicly Involved
The IRS designation for traditional non-profits and community groups is 501(c)(3) and legally forbids their political involvement thus they're intentionally mute, fearful, and avoidant of political involvement beyond their stated cause. Some organize a related 527/501(c)(4) organization to do political advocacy, else, they'll defend their IRS tax-free designation.

## Religious
Almost outcast from Asian America as they have 81% voting for alt-right networks (source: AP VoteCast 2020) and revel in disinformation and conspiracy theories, we'll see if they change. Thusfar, they're mute on such issues.

## Fundraise for victims, families
As well as movements and research. Emulate the funding which so many other movements have done at scale.

## Get Educated
Many even AAPI, socially involved people don't know the history, lessons, and news about this topic. In a nutshell, acknowledging consistently the backdrop of white supremacy and capitalism how they pit racial groups against one another for the scraps when the focus should be on the larger pie. The sick rise of Asians touting anti-black, anti-others, anti-white (Asian supremacists, foreign interference actors, Imperial Japanese, wumao army, etc.), organized crime syndicates, etc. are not credible routes to a better future even if they vigorously defend our community.

## Include Employers

Speak about issues (not politics) at workplaces. Hold to task companies' marketing, recruitment purporting to support individuals. [Out bad employers](//glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm). Make a company a sponsor of a cause which gives not just funds but also connections, visibility, and reach.

Orgs: [GlassDoor](//glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm)

## Politics
Orgs: I made a [list](//twitter.com/i/lists/904070897807523840/members). TLDR: see [Yappie](//t.co/2LzYOsloxc)

### Pressure Electeds
Increase local resources for mental health, corrections, prosecution, law enforcement, local and community policing (PD's aren't only about SWAT and counterterrorism though those are also important), improved lawmaking process, community participation in all the aforementioned, disaggregated data, etc.

### Help Electeds
Volunteer for them because they do so much needing help including constituent services, media/PR/spokespersons/syndicates, outreach, legal research, writing, legislative coalition building, community affairs/relations, etc. Their campaigns are separate but needed orgs, too.

### Participate, Engage
Civil rhetoric is lacking, decline in political candidates' moderation and compassion and compromise sills,  worsening political choices, increasing political extremism, etc. all threaten the American political process. Insist, enforce, and encourage proper candor. Idealistic but necessary else the world burns.

### Include Other Leaders
Build solidarity with other politically involved entities: faith leaders, prospective candidates (court opponents [#YangGang](//twitter.com/hashtag/yanggang) style), etc. and with other racially oppressed groups (BLM, NAACP, [Brady Campaign](//facebook.com/bradycampaign), etc.)

Learn, teach the origins of racial diviseness and specific ethnic histories in the U.S. Talk to family members. You can choose your approach from far-left's [but-they're-just-acting-out](//medium.com/@kmttran/talking-to-my-non-black-asian-mom-about-property-destruction-64092062adc8) way to the [LettersForBlackLives](//docs.google.com/document/d/10syOzyDfJfmw9Bg89cam8wj29sa_rJHoDXFbrhrFJLs/edit) (awesome example of collaboration) to a [comics approach](//lettersforblacklives.com/letters-for-black-lives-comic-edition-d840921c0141).

## Build solidarity through intersectionality
There's thousands of allied shared orgs, movements, causes, groups, and allies in so many areas, notably arts, cultural, ethnics, and social movements who've been doing related work for years, too. They might intersect more with your existing, deeper interests.
