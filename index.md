# What _you_ can do About anti-Asian Hate
Read a simpler version of this page at [StopAsianHate.info](//t.co/f8iWLI8kuU) ([Tweet](//twitter.com/joeyng/status/1362922187611537408)); a [summary](//facebook.com/invisibleasians/posts/103494218467377); a [link list](//t.co/UiClM97MOj) ([alt](//bit.ly/aapilove)); an [explanation](//nextshark.com/anti-asian-assaults-racism-may-lee); or below.

## Be, Stay Informed
[Track the hate](//twitter.com/RachelRoh) namely in [social media](//stopaapihate.org/reportsreleases) and groups. 

### Train your Algorithms
All media profits from tracking user engagement to sell advertising access. Exploit it for your benefit. It's not "AI". It's advertising data haul.

#### Join Groups
ClubHouse's [AAPI Townhall](//docs.google.com/document/d/1ofWEB6ZIPI6emYuYwPwWOuFcqGpk9tXgXLmXxeJqsIQ) has been foremost.

Train Facebook's algorithm to not bury anti-Asian American hate. All Facebook use closely tracks user engagement (not just clicks, but lingers, scrolls, etc.) for big data for Facebook Beacon sales for advertiser dollars. Nearly all groups filter membership requests to remove trolls, vandals, etc.
* [AsiansNOW](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow) — founded by the famed professor Dr. Larry Shinagawa to raise social awareness in the Asian diaspora (heavily East Asian as is typical) and the biggest at 13,500 members; especially useful is topic tag "[racism](//facebook.com/groups/1450447971654849/post_tags/?post_tag_id=1956436984389276)"; run by 8 active, experienced admins including yours truly
* [The #StopAsianHate To Do List](//facebook.com/groups/2671020096466397) - focuses on action
* [Asians Today](//facebook.com/groups/asianstoday) — an independent fork of [AsiansNOW](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow) is a less moderated version of [AsiansNOW](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow) to expand its radius; run by former non-overlapping moderators of [AsiansNOW](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow)
* [Stop Racism Against Asian Americans](//facebook.com/groups/2527967444134996) - more empathy and heart and optimism; run by Adam Manhbaoboua who’s very empathetic himself
* [Asian Americans United Against Violence](//facebook.com/groups/240524854010441) - emphasizes quicker, more aggressive justice and anger against perps — run by TaeWoo Kim, a strident defender of the community and well known in LA
* [Crimes Against Asians](//facebook.com/groups/crimesagainstasians) - was a super-popular private group, now less popular due to bad news burnout; not to be confused with its public page of the same name — run by NextShark with the same clickbait model and approving only their own content
* [Asian Americans (& allies ) VS the Model Minority Myth](//facebook.com/groups/792343574185384) — specializes in fighting the model minority myth — run by Errol Lam and yours truly
* [Asians Not Brainwashed By Media Lapping Up Amy Chua (ANBM-LUAC)](//facebook.com/groups/420895108043294) - excellent quality curation of Asian American history, arts, and less political more advocacy — run by a friend, the Brooklyn-based artist Akiko Ichikawa; not to be confused with the similarly named [Asians Not Brainwashed by Media - Official Group (ANBM)](//facebook.com/groups/anbmsource/) which starts off seemingly innocently for the community but is a men's rights free-for-all
* [Global Asians for Action and Social Change (GAASC)](//facebook.com/groups/GlobalAsians) - focused on actionable social change — run by very principled all-stars, but perhaps too sedate for this era
* [API Hate Crimes & Equity Initiatives (AHCEI)](//facebook.com/groups/822050604959359) (formerly API Crime Info Hub) — positive advocacy, including writing to encourage AAPI electeds — run by Yun-Sook Kim, an experienced LA-based community leader and yours truly
* [Unity: Strength in Numbers](//facebook.com/groups/58419352884917) — positive news — founded by Nina Koo, a reliable NYC/SGV organizer, and Linda Chan; moderated by other veteran NYC organizers

Just say no:
* [Asian American Alliance Against Racism (AAAAR)](//facebook.com/groups/142455397210001) - warning: paranoid, poorly-run group with rampant, intentional, toxic, infighting, a no-care free-for-all hands-off except when the admins' sense of control is threatened, no-warning removals for no given reason; they reap the chaos they sowed; as such, they've been co-opted by the aforementioned groups

## Report Publicly, Privately

## Help victims
### Patrol, Guard, Watch, Protect, Defend, Intervene

Help the victim in real time. Train to avoid shock, delay, silence. It's not illegal to use force in self-defense. Train in [firearms](//t.co/DgmItFWXAj), weapons (umbrellas, pepper spray, bear spray, belts, hammers, etc.), martial arts, [self-defense](//youtube.com/watch?v=woL9f-R-OTs&list=PLewDws3GRrGgnx6bneWAXJvm9K3mJ98TS&index=1).

### Report Crimes
[StopAAPIHate.org](//t.co/tjHqwy28HY) is the de facto crime reporting as run by [A3PCon](//t.co/2IIhw7taKo) taking over where [OCA](//t.co/eNTNYoHB4z) stopped with [AAPIHateCrimes](//t.co/yX5ogNiir4) in 2018.

Victims often won't report crimes due to language difficulty, cultural shame for causing attention, and/or fear of inconvenience. Attackers have openly stated they intentionally target such victims and often commit crime to exert power. Reporting helps to remove their power. Bystanders: get video and [report](//stopaapihate.org/reportincident).

For confidential reporting with public reporting and protected anonymity (i.e. not _NY Post_ who unethically, unwantedly outed [Lauren Kwei](//www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-emt-lauren-kwei-1103336) who [reappropriated her name and fame](//rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-medic-lauren-kwei-new-york-post-interview-1104943)), see [Dion Lim](//facebook.com/DionLimTV) and [Betty Yu](//facebook.com/BettyYuLive) in SF, [CeFaan Kim](//facebook.com/CeFaanKimTV) and [Vicky Nguyen](//t.co/H1idgZnvam) and [William Lex Ham](//twitter.com/WillLexHam) in NYC, [Nydia Han](//t.co/LyKHF4szvR) in Philadelphia, Randall Yip at [AsAmNews](//facebook.com/AsAmNews), et al.

For [#metoo](//twitter.com/hashtag/metoo) related, see [TimesUp Help](//t.co/878xO8wRJv) or [Emily Chang](//twitter.com/emilychangtv), author of _[Broptopia](//t.co/rfdUG7kt2d)_. [AAJA](//t.co/q3akNvOApN) has more (I've a [list](//twitter.com/i/lists/82469881)).

[HateCrimeBook](//t.co/xFmQcABL79) is excellently written in 7 languages.

Warnings:
1. Benny Luo's [NextShark](//twitter.com/NextShark) is clickbait whose [credibility](//twitter.com/eugenegu/status/1358846497861718018) threatens the cause; some contributors are more credible such as [May Lee](//t.co/NUdbR2XXPD) of [The May Lee Show](//twitter.com/TheMayLeeShow) though they share in the attention
1. _Asian Dawn_ foments hate namely against blacks since it's the most clickbaitey; they're full of controversy they enjoy sowing
1. [NBCAsianAmerica](//twitter.com/nbcasianamerica) which downplayed, ignored incidents for years, has only 2 writers, and [deleted Yang](//twitter.com/hashtag/MSNBCfearsYang)
1. [PlanA Magazine](//t.co/60tIjt9LQW) is purposefully abrasive, condesending intentionally hate monger to grow readership
1. so many anonymous like [Asian Lives Matter](//youtube.com/channel/UC6cWZcuD9kNnuaWAoIeDibg)
1. [most media ignore Asians](//thecrimson.com/article/2021/2/25/conde-media-coverage-asian-america-issues) as their goals are not ours

This is different than reporting crimes since it's longer, not necessarily about a crime, and can be fiction. This is different than media as it's about our stories not others' stories.

### Represent in Media
Media includes not just entertainment industry (see [Nancy Wang Yuen](//t.co/43HC1QkOFX)) and journalism ([political journalists](//twitter.com/i/lists/1231328521475231745), [AAPI journalists](//twitter.com/i/lists/87671182)), but all public life outlets.

AAPI television series: [Wikipedia](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_television_series_with_Asian_leads) lacking only _[Queens the Series](//t.co/NsMdJoaVeL)_.

For casting opportunities, industry email groups are best. Barely any get reposted to [groups actively keeping up with the news](//medium.com/@richardc020/washthehate-43cb5d0de773?source=friends_link&sk=d488ff5071ef42d7c1b99034288d8421).

Too many agencies are run strongly by dominant white dudes with big egos, big clients (just one keeps all the bills paid), and big no-cares of to bullying others, so while non-US, agencies like [Rice Bowl Studio](//bit.ly/postgradarticle) are more worth your agency spend.

Blog entries for [ATL OTP](//blog.yelp.com/2020/06/meet-the-asian-american-pacific-islander-business-owners-of-otp), [SGV](//blog.yelp.com/2020/05/celebrating-aapi-business-owners) inform [my list](). Warning is that Asian restaurants are too often not Asian _owned_, I made [a list]() of those. Note we must keep a watch that folks like [Arielle Haspel](//t.co/rNKXotRvM7) never again disrespect Asian cuisine.

## Get Justice
Do so in a way that doesn’t perpetuate more racism, hate, mass incarceration culture, poverty, inequity (not hte kind that eliminates grades, rather, the kind that allows for real merit, a tricky idea to implement), oppression by the unfairly empowered, etc. Bail reform lets perps in recent crimes back onto streets within hours of apprehension, but not all Democratic Party movements are wrong. Reform such imprecise legal efforts. Follow their playbook and give credit.

### Translate
Get “language justice” and in-language access at all levels. Volunteer your translation skill.

### Disaggregate Data
Because not breaking out Asian data leads to the model minority myth as if we're all the richest, most white adjacent, harmless, docile, obedient worker bees. [#NotYourModelMinority](//twitter.com/hashtag/NotYourModelMinority)

## Raise Awareness
Many in our own community and nearly all outside of our news echo chambers do not know. Tell them. Social media is the key. One-on-one even better. In person even better for better communication. Don't preach to the choir. Reach those outside of self-selecting environments like those listed here.

## Be Civicly Involved
The IRS designation for traditional non-profits and community groups is 501(c)(3) and legally forbids their political involvement with campaigns or candidates but the threat is vague thus they stay intentionally mute, fearful, and avoidant to avoid being taxed. Some orgs start a related 527/501(c)(4) organization to do political advocacy, else, they'll defend their IRS tax-free designation.

## Inspirational, Motivational

I made [a list](//twitter.com/i/lists/1185503438127423490/members).

## Religious
Outcast from Asian America as 81% align with the alt-right (source: AP VoteCast 2020) and revel in disinformation and conspiracy theories, [they're trying to reclaim their image](//t.co/qhbpHqyWNB). Thusfar, they're mute.

Speaking of outcasts, this is a good place to place a list of those most outcast from Asian America because they're horrible human beings promoting forces which increase threats of attacks on Asian Americans, though most are non-religious so move this somewhere later:

## Get Educated
Many even AAPI, socially involved people don't know the history, lessons, and news about this topic. [Read the history](history). Acknowledge how white supremacy and capitalism pit racial groups against one another for the pie scraps when could grow the pie. The sick rise of Asians touting anti-black, anti-others, anti-white (Asian supremacists, foreign interference actors, Imperial Japanese, wumao army, etc.), organized crime syndicates, etc. are not credible routes to a better future even if they vigorously defend our community.

## Include Employers
Speak about issues (not politics) at workplaces as much as you can. Hold to task companies' marketing, recruitment purporting to support individuals. [Out bad employers](//glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm). Make a company a sponsor of a cause which gives not just funds but also connections, visibility, and reach. We however must also recognzie not all roles, orgs enable it so [those who can speak, speak](//twitter.com/minjinlee11/status/1374060259619274759).

Orgs: [GlassDoor](//glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm)

### Advoacate, Pressure, Lobby, Influence
Increase local resources for mental health, corrections (not mere incarceration for for-profit contractors), prosecution, law enforcement (they need public trust), local and community policing (PD's aren't only about SWAT and counterterrorism though also important), improved lawmaking process (legislation happens at all levels involving all citizenry), community participation in all the aforementioned.

### Help Electeds
Volunteer for them because they do so much needing help including constituent services, media/PR/spokespersons/syndicates, outreach, legal research, writing, legislative coalition building, community affairs/relations, etc. Their campaigns are separate but needed orgs, too.

### Participate, Engage
Civil rhetoric is lacking, decline in political candidates' moderation and compassion and compromise sills,  worsening political choices, increasing political extremism, etc. all threaten the American political process. Insist, enforce, and encourage proper candor. Idealistic but necessary else the world burns.

I made a [list of Facebook groups](//medium.com/@richardc020/washthehate-43cb5d0de773?source=friends_link&sk=d488ff5071ef42d7c1b99034288d8421).

### Include Other Leaders
Build solidarity with other politically involved entities: faith leaders, prospective candidates (court opponents [#YangGang](//twitter.com/hashtag/yanggang) style), etc. and with other racially oppressed groups (BLM, NAACP, [Brady Campaign](//facebook.com/bradycampaign), etc.)

Learn, teach the origins of racial diviseness and specific ethnic histories in the U.S. Talk to family members. You can choose your approach from far-left's [but-they're-just-acting-out](//medium.com/@kmttran/talking-to-my-non-black-asian-mom-about-property-destruction-64092062adc8) way to the [LettersForBlackLives](//docs.google.com/document/d/10syOzyDfJfmw9Bg89cam8wj29sa_rJHoDXFbrhrFJLs) (awesome open collaboration) to a [comics approach](//lettersforblacklives.com/letters-for-black-lives-comic-edition-d840921c0141).

## Build solidarity through Intersectionality
There's thousands of allied shared orgs, movements, causes, groups, and allies in so many areas, notably arts, cultural, ethnics, and social movements who've been doing related work for years, too. They might intersect more with your existing, deeper interests.
