# What _you_ can do About anti-Asian Hate

## Be, Stay Informed
[Track the hate](//twitter.com/RachelRoh) namely in [social media](//stopaapihate.org/reportsreleases); join groups actively informed (see "Groups" below); read a [summary](//facebook.com/invisibleasians/posts/103494218467377) or [an explanation](//nextshark.com/anti-asian-assaults-racism-may-lee) we're not quiet.

Simpler version of this page: [StopAsianHate.info](//t.co/f8iWLI8kuU) ([Tweet](//twitter.com/joeyng/status/1362922187611537408))

## Groups
Facebook groups to join and train Facebook's algorithm to not bury anti-Asian American hate in its chase for user engagement for big data for Facebook Beacon sales for advertiser dollars. Nearly all groups filter membership requests to remove trolls, vandals, etc.
* [AsiansNOW](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow) — founded by the famed professor Dr. Larry Shinagawa to raise social awareness in the Asian diaspora (heavily East Asian as is typical) and the biggest at 13,500 members; especially useful is topic tag "[racism](//facebook.com/groups/1450447971654849/post_tags/?post_tag_id=1956436984389276)"; run by experienced admins including yours truly, founded by the late Dr. Shinagawa
* [Asians Today](//facebook.com/groups/asianstoday) — an independent fork of [AsiansNOW](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow) which is a less moderated version of [AsiansNOW](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow) to expand its radius; run by former non-overlapping moderators of [AsiansNOW](//facebook.com/groups/asiansnow)
* [Stop Racism Against Asian Americans](//facebook.com/groups/2527967444134996) - more empathy and heart and optimism; run by Adam Manhbaoboua who’s very empathetic himself
* [Asian Americans United Against Violence](//facebook.com/groups/240524854010441) - emphasizes quicker, more aggressive justice and anger against perps — run by TaeWoo Kim, a strident defender of the community and well known in LA
* [Crimes Against Asians](//facebook.com/groups/crimesagainstasians) - was a super-popular private group, now less popular due to bad news burnout; not to be confused with its public page of the same name — run by NextShark with the same clickbait model and approving only their own content
* [Asian Americans (& allies ) VS the Model Minority Myth](//facebook.com/groups/792343574185384) — specializes in fighting the model minority myth — run by Errol Lam and yours truly
* [Asians Not Brainwashed By Media Lapping Up Amy Chua](//facebook.com/groups/420895108043294/) - excellent quality curation of Asian American history, arts, and less political more advocacy — run by a friend, the Brooklyn-based artist Akiko Ichikawa; not to be confused with the similarly named [Asians Not Brainwashed by Media - Official Group](//facebook.com/groups/anbmsource/) which starts off seemingly innocently for the community but is a men's rights free-for-all
* [Global Asians for Action and Social Change (GAASC)](//facebook.com/groups/GlobalAsians) - focused on actionable social change — run by very principled all-stars, but perhaps too sedate for this era
* [API Hate Crimes & Equity Initiatives (AHCEI)](//facebook.com/groups/822050604959359) (formerly API Crime Info Hub) — positive advocacy, including writing to encourage AAPI electeds — run by Yun-Sook Kim, an experienced LA-based community leader and yours truly
* [Unity: Strength in Numbers](//facebook.com/groups/58419352884917) — positive news — founded by Nina Koo, a reliable NYC/SGV organizer, and Linda Chan; moderated by other veteran NYC organizers
And orgs:
* [AAAAR — Asian American Alliance Against Racism](//facebook.com/groups/142455397210001) - as name says; used to be make alliances with allies to increase our power but now paranoid about any mentions of other groups to the point they delete such comment; run tightly though their purpose is co-opted by so many other groups thus they've a rule strictly banning any mention of other groups

## Keep a Public Report
While there's [StopAAPIHate.org](//t.co/tjHqwy28HY) to centralize reporting, there're still missing public information thus edit [Wikipedia's a long list of such attacks](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia_and_racism_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic#New_York) and review [its history for vandalism](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xenophobia_and_racism_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic&action=history).

There're so many formatsi: [video about AAPI history](//youtube.com/watch?v=rFbHml5ba0M) (13:13), [cartoon about what we feel](//instagram.com/p/CMtl68GAtZe).

## Help victims
### Patrol, Guard, Watch, Protect, Defend, Intervene

Help the victim in real time. Train to avoid shock, delay, silence. It's not illegal to use force in self-defense. Train in [firearms](//t.co/DgmItFWXAj), other weaponry, martial arts, [self-defense](//youtube.com/watch?v=woL9f-R-OTs&list=PLewDws3GRrGgnx6bneWAXJvm9K3mJ98TS&index=1).

### Report Crimes
[StopAAPIHate.org](//t.co/tjHqwy28HY) is the de facto crime reporting as run by [A3PCon](//t.co/2IIhw7taKo) taking over where [OCA](//t.co/eNTNYoHB4z) stopped with [AAPIHateCrimes](//t.co/yX5ogNiir4) in 2018.

Victims often won't report crimes due to language difficulty, cultural shame for causing attention, and/or fear of inconvenience. Attackers have openly stated they intentionally target such victims and often commit crime to exert power. Reporting helps to remove their power. Bystanders: get video and [report](//stopaapihate.org/reportincident).

For confidential reporting with public reporting and protected anonymity (i.e. not _NY Post_ who unethically, unwantedly outed [Lauren Kwei](//www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-emt-lauren-kwei-1103336) who [reappropriated her name and fame](//rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-medic-lauren-kwei-new-york-post-interview-1104943)), see [Dion Lim](//facebook.com/DionLimTV) and [Betty Yu](//facebook.com/BettyYuLive) in SF, [CeFaan Kim](//facebook.com/CeFaanKimTV) and [Vicky Nguyen](//t.co/H1idgZnvam) and [William Lex Ham](//twitter.com/WillLexHam) in NYC, [Nydia Han](//t.co/LyKHF4szvR) in Philadelphia, Randall Yip at [AsAmNews](//facebook.com/AsAmNews), et al.

[HateCrimeBook](//t.co/xFmQcABL79) is excellently written in 7 languages.

Warnings:
1. Benny Luo's [NextShark](//twitter.com/NextShark) which is problematic clickbait whose [credibility](//twitter.com/eugenegu/status/1358846497861718018) threatens the cause; some contributors are more credible such as [May Lee](//t.co/NUdbR2XXPD) of [The May Lee Show](//twitter.com/TheMayLeeShow) though they share in the attention
1. _Asian Dawn_ which willfully foments hate namely against blacks since it's the most accessible; they're full of controversy
1. [NBCAsianAmerica](//twitter.com/nbcasianamerica) which downplayed, ignored incidents for years, has only 2 writers, and its relative MSNBC [deleted Yang](//twitter.com/hashtag/MSNBCfearsYang)
1. [PlanA Magazine](//t.co/60tIjt9LQW) which goes so strong to the point of attacking everyone as to intentionally use hate mongering to grow readership
1. anonymous media which seeks to divide a-la-Asian-Dawn like YouTube channel [Asian Lives Matter](//youtube.com/channel/UC6cWZcuD9kNnuaWAoIeDibg)
1. [most media ignore Asians](//thecrimson.com/article/2021/2/25/conde-media-coverage-asian-america-issues).

This is different than reporting crimes since it's longer, not necessarily about a crime, and can be fiction. This is different than media as it's about our stories not others' stories.


### Represent in Media
Media includes not just entertainment industry (see [Nancy Wang Yuen](//t.co/43HC1QkOFX)) and journalism ([political journalists](//twitter.com/i/lists/1231328521475231745), [AAPI journalists](//twitter.com/i/lists/87671182)), but all public life outlets.

For AAPI television series, see [Wikipedia](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_television_series_with_Asian_leads) lacking only _[Queens the Series](//t.co/NsMdJoaVeL)_.

For casting opportunities, industry email groups are best. Barely any get reposted to [groups actively keeping up with the news](//medium.com/@richardc020/washthehate-43cb5d0de773?source=friends_link&sk=d488ff5071ef42d7c1b99034288d8421).

News Specials: "[Stop the Hate: The Rise in Violence Against Asian Americans](//facebook.com/CeFaanKimTV/posts/1618634198331654)" aired on ABCNews Live on Thursday, March 4, 2021 at 8p (ET), see the 00:15 long [trailer](//youtu.be/VTH9hTderTY?t=3030) and the 00:45 long [show](//youtu.be/VTH9hTderTY?t=4563); [WaPo's "Rise in Anti-Asian Violence"](//youtu.be/VT1mDgDjJ5g?t=10); PBS's "[Asian Americans](//t.co/L4hi3AIcVD)" is 5h long but a comprehensive all-in look at our history, good and bad, all free online; Betty Yu's "[Asians Under Attack: The Bay Area Reacts](//cbsloc.al/3vLdnbD) aired March 21 at 21:00 local time. A followup on ABCNews was "[Murder in Atlanta]()".

Articles: So many. Probably better left for some news roll in another system. Nonetheless, for now: "[A History Of Anti-Asian Racism](//t.co/cbM4tCbVYS)" by [Sam Sanders](//t.co/SclbzwJQzT); "[The long Western legacy of violence against Asian Americans](//t.co/hpkT9L4cCs)" by [Jane C.

Warning is that Asian restaurants are too often not Asian _owned_, I made [a list]() of those. Note we must keep a watch that folks like [Arielle Haspel](//t.co/rNKXotRvM7) never again disrespect Asian cuisine.

## Get Justice
Do so in a way that doesn’t perpetuate more racism, hate, mass incarceration culture, etc. Bail reform let the perps in recent crimes back to the streets which isn't to say all Democratic Party movements are wrong. Reform such imprecise legal efforts. Follow their playbook.

## Raise Awareness

The IRS designation for traditional non-profits and community groups is 501(c)(3) and legally forbids their political involvement with campaigns or candidates but the threat is vague thus they stay intentionally mute, fearful, and avoidant to avoid being taxed. Some orgs start a related 527/501(c)(4) organization to do political advocacy, else, they'll defend their IRS tax-free designation.

### Civic Politics
These are ones whose goals are nonpartisan political involvement.

### Kids, Youth, Pre-Teens, Teenagers
They're our future, more involved, more assimilated (i.e. familiar with the enemy, its tactics, relevance), and blessed with more time.

## Inspirational, Motivational

I made [a list](//twitter.com/i/lists/1185503438127423490/members).

## Religious
Outcast from Asian America as 81% align with the alt-right (source: AP VoteCast 2020) and revel in disinformation and conspiracy theories, [they're trying to reclaim their image](//t.co/qhbpHqyWNB). Thusfar, they're mute.

Speaking of outcasts, this is a good place to place a list of those most outcast from Asian America because they're horrible human beings promoting forces which increase threats of attacks on Asian Americans, though most are non-religious so move this somewhere later:

## Fundraise for victims, families
Plus movements, research. Emulate others.

Orgs: [Uncle Vicha](//gofundme.com/f/84yearold-killed-in-san-francisco), [Yong Zheng](//t.co/OR3E0x977z), [Protect Our Elders](//papermag.com/protect-elders-anti-asian-violence-2650624015.html) by [Eda C Yu](//instagram.com/edacyu) [finished distribution](//instagram.com/p/CMu4at2BFbk) with [many more](//instagram.com/p/CM5OktEBGEO), [AAPI Community Fund](//t.co/I8WIuYa2V3) ([source](//twitter.com/goldhouseco/status/1366766574758199300))

## Get Educated
Many even AAPI, socially involved people don't know the history, lessons, and news about this topic. In a nutshell, acknowledging consistently the backdrop of white supremacy and capitalism how they pit racial groups against one another for the scraps when the focus should be on the larger pie. The sick rise of Asians touting anti-black, anti-others, anti-white (Asian supremacists, foreign interference actors, Imperial Japanese, wumao army, etc.), organized crime syndicates, etc. are not credible routes to a better future even if they vigorously defend our community.

## Include Employers
Speak about issues (not politics) at workplaces as much as you can. Hold to task companies' marketing, recruitment purporting to support individuals. [Out bad employers](//glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm). Make a company a sponsor of a cause which gives not just funds but also connections, visibility, and reach. We however must also recognzie not all roles, orgs enable it so [those who can speak, speak](//twitter.com/minjinlee11/status/1374060259619274759).

Orgs: [GlassDoor](//glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm)

## Politics, Public Officials, Electeds
It's [false that AAPI are politically unvinvolved](//twitter.com/xiranjayzhao/status/1285368446033657856).

Orgs: I made a [list](//twitter.com/i/lists/904070897807523840/members) to network, focus power. TLDR: see [Yappie](//t.co/2LzYOsloxc)

More Orgs: [LAANY](//facebook.com/LAANY.org)

### Advoacate, Pressure, Lobby, Influence
Increase local resources for mental health, corrections (not mere incarceration for for-profit contractors), prosecution, law enforcement (they need public trust), local and community policing (PD's aren't only about SWAT and counterterrorism though also important), improved lawmaking process (legislation happens at all levels involving all citizenry), community participation in all the aforementioned.

### Help Electeds
Volunteer for them because they do so much needing help including constituent services, media/PR/spokespersons/syndicates, outreach, legal research, writing, legislative coalition building, community affairs/relations, etc. Their campaigns are separate but needed orgs, too.

### Participate, Engage
Civil rhetoric is lacking, decline in political candidates' moderation and compassion and compromise sills,  worsening political choices, increasing political extremism, etc. all threaten the American political process. Insist, enforce, and encourage proper candor. Idealistic but necessary else the world burns.

I made a [list of Facebook groups](//medium.com/@richardc020/washthehate-43cb5d0de773?source=friends_link&sk=d488ff5071ef42d7c1b99034288d8421).

### Include Other Leaders
Build solidarity with other politically involved entities: faith leaders, prospective candidates (court opponents [#YangGang](//twitter.com/hashtag/yanggang) style), etc. and with other racially oppressed groups (BLM, NAACP, [Brady Campaign](//facebook.com/bradycampaign), etc.)

Learn, teach the origins of racial diviseness and specific ethnic histories in the U.S. Talk to family members. You can choose your approach from far-left's [but-they're-just-acting-out](//medium.com/@kmttran/talking-to-my-non-black-asian-mom-about-property-destruction-64092062adc8) way to the [LettersForBlackLives](//docs.google.com/document/d/10syOzyDfJfmw9Bg89cam8wj29sa_rJHoDXFbrhrFJLs) (awesome open collaboration) to a [comics approach](//lettersforblacklives.com/letters-for-black-lives-comic-edition-d840921c0141).

## Build solidarity through Intersectionality
There's thousands of allied shared orgs, movements, causes, groups, and allies in so many areas, notably arts, cultural, ethnics, and social movements who've been doing related work for years, too. They might intersect more with your existing, deeper interests.

### Education
Education is inherently a social movement.

Todo: add AAPI history to curricula (very hard as every municipality and textbook deciding organ is highly fragmented), add Lunar New Year to holidays
