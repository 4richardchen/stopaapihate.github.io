Please contribute. There're tons of needs. I hope GitHub Pages is the best way to get such, short of a Wiki.

Keep todo's in GitHub Projects not elsewhere like in the About page, etc.

If you're unsure what to do, [here's a guide](//guides.github.com/features/pages/). For those experienced, clone the [code](//github.com/4richardchen/stopaapihate.github.io), [run this site locally](//github.com/Starefossen/docker-github-pages) with 'docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -p "4000:4000" starefossen/github-pages', wait, and check [its deployed version](//stopaapihate.github.io).
